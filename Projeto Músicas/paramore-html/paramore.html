        <p>Well, she lives in a fairy tale<br>
        Somewhere too far for us to find<br>
        Forgotten the taste and smell<br>
        Of a world that she's left behind<br>
        It's all about the exposure the lens<br>
        I told her the angles were all wrong<br>
        Now she's ripping wings off of butterflies</p>
        <br>
        <p>Keep your feet on the ground<br>
        When your head's in the clouds</p>
        <br>
        <p>Well, go get your shovel<br>
        And we'll dig a deep hole<br>
        To bury the castle, bury the castle<br>
        Go get your shovel<br>
        And we'll dig a deep hole<br>
        To bury the castle, bury the castle</p>
        <br>
        <p>Pa ra pa pa ra pa pa ra</p>
        <br>
        <p>So one day, he found her crying<br>
        Coiled up on the dirty ground<br>
        Her prince finally came to save her<br>
        And the rest you can figure out<br>
        But it was a trick and the clock struck twelve<br>
        Well, make sure to build your home brick by boring brick<br>
        Or the wolf's gonna blow it down</p>
        <br>
        <p>Keep your feet on the ground<br>
        When your head's in the clouds</p>
        
        <p>Well, go get your shovel<br>
        And we'll dig a deep hole<br>
        To bury the castle, bury the castle<br>
        Go get your shovel<br>
        And we'll dig a deep hole<br>
        And we'll bury the castle, bury the castle</p>
        <br>
        <p>Well, you built up a world of magic<br>
        Because your real life is tragic<br>
        Yeah, you built up a world of magic</p>
        <br>
        <p>Well, if it's not real, you can't hold it in your hand<br>
        You can't feel it with your heart<br>
        And I won't believe it<br>
        But if it's true, you can see it with your eyes<br>
        Oh, even in the dark<br>
        And that's where I want to be, yeah</p>
        <br>
        <p>Go get your shovel (you'll be better)<br>
        And we'll dig a deep hole (off without me now)<br>
        To bury the castle, bury the castle<br>
        Go get your shovel (you'll be better)<br>
        And we'll dig a deep hole (off without me now)<br>
        To bury the castle, bury the castle</p>
        <br>
        <p>Pa ra pa pa ra pa pa ra</p>
